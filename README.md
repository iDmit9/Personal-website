# My personal website

Hi, this is my personal site-porfolio. It was created with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), a React-based framework. In Gatsby we use starters - partially built sites with some default configuration to help get moving faster on creating a certain type of site. I used "gatsby-bulma-quickstart" because I wanted to use the [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) CSS framework - one of the most popular responsive frameworks. For contact I used formspree.
